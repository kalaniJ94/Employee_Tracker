# Employee_Tracker

## Description

This challenge is the first one that I have not entirely finished. Wrestling with a error wasted a couple of days and left me with not enough time to finish. That's not to say, however, that I did not enjoy this challenge. Sql is a unique and powerful language, one that I look forward to exploring more in the future! 

RESUBMIT: I have dived back into the challenge, and totally have resigned my system. I started by greatly simplifying my file structure, making all sql commands come directly out of index.js, and the connection as well. I spent time researching sql commands to update my existing commands and finish those I had incomplete.

Once all necessary packages have been downloaded, right click on index.js in the sidebar. Find 'run in integrated terminal, and type in "node index.js" You will then be given several prompts from which to generate your readme. Once finished, the generated README will appear in the sidebar, within the "Develop" folder. There will be a separate README always present, this is the static README for this project, that you are now reading.
